Installation instructions:

There are two ways of using this package:

1. You can simply copy it in the directory of your script and include it: require_once('cPdfWriter/cPdfWriter.php');
   However this way you is not recommended since you have to copy the package for every script that uses it. 
    
2. (Recommended) However if you want this package installed in a generic way, for example if you have manyer 
   scripts that would use it, then you must put the cPdfWriter package somewhere in your PHP include path.

I recommend uncommenting and setting the include_path in your php.ini file as follows 
(you can change /usr/lib/php to whatever you want):

    include_path = ".:/php/includes:/usr/share/pear:/usr/lib/php"

copy the cPdfWriter directory in /usr/lib/php and then restart the Apache server

    /etc/init.d/httpd restart

and you're set. To use the cPdfWriter class just do

    require_once('cPdfWriter/cPdfWriter.php');
